# Agentic Design Patterns Documentation

A comprehensive visual and textual documentation of 21 essential agentic design patterns for building intelligent AI systems.

## 📚 What's Included

This repository contains three main types of documentation for each pattern:

### 🔷 Mermaid Diagrams (`/mermaid-diagrams`)
Visual flowcharts in plain English showing how each pattern works, designed to be easily understood without technical jargon.

### 💬 Pattern Discussions (`/pattern-discussion`)
Detailed explanations covering:
- When to use each pattern
- Where it fits in your architecture
- Pros and cons
- Implementation considerations

### 🎨 ASCII Art Diagrams (`/ascii-art`)
Text-based diagrams perfect for copying into Miro boards, documentation, or anywhere that doesn't support rich graphics.

## 🎯 The 21 Patterns

### Core Patterns
1. **Prompt Chaining** - Breaking complex tasks into sequential steps
2. **Routing** - Directing requests to the right handler
3. **Parallelization** - Running multiple tasks simultaneously
4. **Reflection** - Self-evaluation and improvement
5. **Tool Use** - Integrating external capabilities

### Advanced Patterns
6. **Planning** - Strategic task decomposition
7. **Multi-Agent Collaboration** - Coordinating multiple agents
8. **Memory Management** - Storing and retrieving context
9. **Learning and Adaptation** - Improving over time
10. **Model Context Protocol** - Standardized agent communication

### System Patterns
11. **Goal Setting and Monitoring** - Tracking objectives
12. **Exception Handling and Recovery** - Graceful error management
13. **Human-in-the-Loop** - Incorporating human feedback
14. **Knowledge Retrieval (RAG)** - Accessing external knowledge
15. **Inter-Agent Communication** - Agent-to-agent messaging

### Optimization Patterns
16. **Resource-Aware Optimization** - Efficient resource usage
17. **Reasoning Techniques** - Structured thinking approaches
18. **Guardrails/Safety Patterns** - Ensuring safe operations
19. **Evaluation and Monitoring** - Performance tracking

### Strategic Patterns
20. **Prioritization** - Managing task importance
21. **Exploration and Discovery** - Finding new solutions

## 🚀 Quick Start
