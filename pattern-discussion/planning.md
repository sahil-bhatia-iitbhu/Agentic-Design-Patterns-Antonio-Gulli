# Planning Pattern

## When to Use

- **Complex multi-step projects**: When tasks have multiple dependencies and phases
- **Goal-oriented workflows**: When working toward specific, measurable objectives
- **Resource-constrained operations**: When managing budgets, time, or computational limits
- **Uncertain environments**: When adaptability to changing conditions is needed
- **Collaborative tasks**: When coordinating multiple agents or tools
- **Long-running processes**: When tasks span extended timeframes

## Where It Fits

- **Project management automation**: Breaking down projects into executable tasks
- **Software development**: Planning features from requirements to deployment
- **Research projects**: Organizing literature review, experimentation, and analysis
- **Content production**: Planning multi-part content series or campaigns
- **Business process automation**: Orchestrating complex business workflows

## Pros

- **Strategic execution**: Transforms reactive agents into proactive planners
- **Dependency management**: Handles complex task interdependencies
- **Resource optimization**: Allocates resources efficiently across steps
- **Adaptability**: Can adjust plans based on new information
- **Progress visibility**: Clear tracking of milestone completion
- **Risk mitigation**: Early identification of blockers and issues
- **Reusability**: Plans can be templated and reused

## Cons

- **Upfront overhead**: Planning phase adds initial latency
- **Rigidity risk**: Over-planning can reduce flexibility
- **Complexity**: Managing plan state and dependencies is challenging
- **Prediction errors**: Initial plans may be based on incorrect assumptions
- **Replanning costs**: Adjusting plans mid-execution can be expensive
- **Context limitations**: Long plans may exceed context windows
- **Coordination overhead**: Managing multiple agents increases complexity
