# Resource-Aware Optimization Pattern

## When to Use

- **Cost-sensitive operations**: When managing API or compute costs
- **High-volume processing**: Optimizing large-scale operations
- **Variable workloads**: Different tasks need different resources
- **Budget constraints**: Operating within financial limits
- **Performance requirements**: Balancing speed vs cost
- **Multi-tenant systems**: Fair resource allocation across users

## Where It Fits

- **SaaS platforms**: Managing per-customer resource usage
- **Batch processing**: Optimizing large data processing jobs
- **Real-time systems**: Balancing latency and cost
- **Development environments**: Using cheaper models for testing
- **Production systems**: Optimizing operational costs

## Pros

- **Cost reduction**: Significant savings on API and compute costs
- **Performance optimization**: Right-sized resources for each task
- **Scalability**: Efficient resource use enables growth
- **Flexibility**: Dynamic adjustment to workload changes
- **Budget control**: Predictable operational costs
- **Quality preservation**: Maintains output quality where needed
- **Automatic optimization**: Self-tuning based on patterns

## Cons

- **Complexity increase**: Resource management adds overhead
- **Quality variations**: Different models produce different results
- **Routing overhead**: Classification step adds latency
- **Monitoring requirements**: Need comprehensive tracking
- **Tuning challenges**: Finding optimal thresholds takes time
- **Cache management**: Maintaining cache coherency
- **User experience**: Inconsistent response times
