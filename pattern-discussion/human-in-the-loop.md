# Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Pattern

## When to Use

- **High-stakes decisions**: When errors have significant consequences
- **Regulatory compliance**: Required human oversight for legal reasons
- **Quality assurance**: Ensuring output meets standards
- **Edge cases**: Handling unusual or ambiguous situations
- **Training data generation**: Using human feedback to improve
- **Trust building**: Gradual automation with human validation

## Where It Fits

- **Content moderation**: Reviewing sensitive or borderline content
- **Medical diagnosis**: Physician verification of AI recommendations
- **Financial approvals**: Human authorization for large transactions
- **Legal document review**: Attorney oversight of contracts
- **Hiring decisions**: Human review of AI-screened candidates

## Pros

- **Quality assurance**: Human judgment catches AI errors
- **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements
- **Learning source**: Human feedback improves system
- **Trust**: Users confident in human oversight
- **Flexibility**: Humans handle edge cases well
- **Accountability**: Clear responsibility chain
- **Risk mitigation**: Prevents costly mistakes

## Cons

- **Scalability limits**: Human bandwidth constrains throughput
- **Cost increase**: Human reviewers are expensive
- **Latency addition**: Waiting for human response delays process
- **Inconsistency**: Different humans make different decisions
- **Fatigue effects**: Quality degrades with reviewer tiredness
- **Training requirements**: Reviewers need domain expertise
- **Availability issues**: 24/7 coverage is challenging
