# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Pattern

## When to Use

- **Enterprise systems**: Building scalable, production-grade AI applications
- **Multi-tool integration**: Connecting to diverse external resources
- **Standardization needs**: Ensuring consistent communication interfaces
- **Security requirements**: Managing access control and permissions
- **Dynamic environments**: Resources that change or evolve over time
- **Interoperability**: Enabling different AI systems to work together

## Where It Fits

- **Enterprise AI platforms**: Standardizing tool and data access
- **Multi-vendor integrations**: Connecting different AI services
- **Microservices architectures**: AI agents accessing distributed services
- **Cloud-native applications**: Managing resources across environments
- **API gateways**: Centralizing AI system access to external resources

## Pros

- **Standardization**: Universal interface for all integrations
- **Discoverability**: Agents can dynamically find available resources
- **Security**: Built-in authentication and authorization
- **Versioning**: Graceful handling of API evolution
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and tracing
- **Reusability**: Write once, use across multiple agents
- **Scalability**: Designed for enterprise-grade deployments

## Cons

- **Implementation overhead**: Requires upfront protocol setup
- **Complexity**: Additional abstraction layer to manage
- **Learning curve**: Teams need to understand MCP concepts
- **Migration effort**: Existing integrations need conversion
- **Performance overhead**: Protocol layer adds latency
- **Vendor support**: Requires ecosystem adoption
- **Debugging complexity**: Additional layer in troubleshooting
