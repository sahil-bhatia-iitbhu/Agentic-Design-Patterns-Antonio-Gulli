# Inter-Agent Communication (A2A) Pattern

## When to Use

- **Complex workflows**: Tasks requiring multiple specialized agents
- **Modular systems**: Building composable agent architectures
- **Distributed processing**: Agents running in different locations
- **Scalable architectures**: Systems that need to grow
- **Collaborative tasks**: Agents working together on problems
- **Service-oriented design**: Agents as microservices

## Where It Fits

- **Enterprise automation**: Coordinating business process agents
- **Research systems**: Agents collaborating on analysis
- **Content production**: Pipeline of content creation agents
- **Trading systems**: Agents coordinating financial decisions
- **Smart city systems**: IoT and service agents communicating

## Pros

- **Modularity**: Clear separation of agent responsibilities
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new agents to the system
- **Flexibility**: Different communication patterns available
- **Fault isolation**: Agent failures don't crash system
- **Reusability**: Agents can be reused in different workflows
- **Debugging support**: Message tracing aids troubleshooting
- **Parallel processing**: Agents can work simultaneously

## Cons

- **Complexity overhead**: Communication protocols add complexity
- **Latency accumulation**: Message passing adds delays
- **Coordination challenges**: Managing agent interactions
- **Debugging difficulty**: Tracing distributed conversations
- **State management**: Maintaining consistency across agents
- **Network dependencies**: Vulnerable to communication failures
- **Security concerns**: Inter-agent authentication needed
