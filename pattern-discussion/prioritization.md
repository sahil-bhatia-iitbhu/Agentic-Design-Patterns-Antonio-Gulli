# Prioritization Pattern

## When to Use

- **Resource constraints**: Limited processing capacity
- **Multiple objectives**: Competing goals and tasks
- **Dynamic environments**: Constantly changing priorities
- **Complex dependencies**: Tasks with interdependencies
- **Time-sensitive operations**: Deadline-driven work
- **Fair scheduling**: Preventing task starvation

## Where It Fits

- **Task management systems**: Workflow orchestration
- **Customer service**: Ticket prioritization
- **Manufacturing**: Production scheduling
- **Healthcare**: Patient triage systems
- **DevOps**: Deployment and maintenance prioritization

## Pros

- **Efficiency**: Optimal use of resources
- **Responsiveness**: High-priority items handled first
- **Fairness**: Prevents indefinite delays
- **Adaptability**: Adjusts to changing conditions
- **Transparency**: Clear prioritization logic
- **Goal alignment**: Tasks ranked by business value
- **Scalability**: Handles growing task queues

## Cons

- **Complexity**: Priority calculation can be complex
- **Overhead**: Continuous reordering costs resources
- **Starvation risk**: Low-priority tasks may wait forever
- **Context switching**: Preemption adds overhead
- **Subjective scoring**: Priority factors may be disputed
- **Dependencies**: Complex dependency management
- **Prediction errors**: Effort estimates may be wrong
