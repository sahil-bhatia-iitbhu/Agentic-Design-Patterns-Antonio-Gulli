# Routing Pattern

## When to Use

- **Multi-domain systems**: When handling diverse request types requiring different expertise
- **Dynamic workflow selection**: When the appropriate process depends on input characteristics
- **Resource optimization**: When different requests require different computational resources
- **Specialized tool access**: When specific tools or APIs are needed based on request type
- **Confidence-based processing**: When you need to handle ambiguous requests differently
- **Load balancing**: When distributing work across multiple specialized agents

## Where It Fits

- **Customer service platforms**: Routing inquiries to appropriate department agents
- **Multi-modal AI systems**: Directing requests to text, image, or code processing pipelines
- **Enterprise automation**: Routing tasks to appropriate business process workflows
- **Content moderation**: Directing content to appropriate review pipelines
- **Healthcare triage**: Routing patient queries to appropriate medical specialists

## Pros

- **Specialization**: Each route can be optimized for specific task types
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new routes without affecting existing ones
- **Efficiency**: Requests are handled by the most appropriate resources
- **Flexibility**: Dynamic routing based on context and confidence
- **Clarity**: Clear separation of concerns between different workflows
- **Performance**: Avoid unnecessary processing for simple requests
- **Maintainability**: Each route can be updated independently

## Cons

- **Router complexity**: The routing logic itself can become a bottleneck
- **Misrouting risks**: Incorrect routing decisions can lead to poor outcomes
- **Latency overhead**: Additional step for routing decision adds delay
- **Training requirements**: Router needs continuous improvement based on feedback
- **Edge cases**: Ambiguous requests may not fit cleanly into categories
- **Coordination overhead**: Managing multiple specialized agents increases complexity
- **Monitoring complexity**: Need to track performance across multiple paths
