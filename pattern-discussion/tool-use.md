# Tool Use (Function Calling) Pattern

## When to Use

- **External data access**: When agents need real-time or dynamic information
- **System integration**: When connecting to databases, APIs, or services
- **Computational tasks**: When precise calculations or data processing is needed
- **File operations**: When reading, writing, or manipulating files
- **Action execution**: When agents need to perform concrete actions
- **Multi-step workflows**: When combining AI reasoning with tool execution

## Where It Fits

- **Research assistants**: Web search, document retrieval, fact-checking
- **Data analysis workflows**: Database queries, calculations, visualizations
- **DevOps automation**: System commands, deployment tools, monitoring
- **Customer service**: CRM access, ticket management, knowledge base queries
- **Content management**: File operations, publishing tools, asset management

## Pros

- **Capability extension**: Agents can perform actions beyond text generation
- **Real-time data**: Access to current information not in training data
- **Precision**: Exact calculations and deterministic operations
- **Integration**: Seamless connection to existing systems and services
- **Automation**: Complete end-to-end workflows without human intervention
- **Flexibility**: Dynamic tool selection based on task requirements
- **Auditability**: Clear log of all tool usage and parameters

## Cons

- **Security risks**: Tool access must be carefully controlled
- **Error propagation**: Tool failures can break entire workflows
- **Latency addition**: Each tool call adds processing time
- **Cost accumulation**: External API calls may incur charges
- **Complexity**: Managing tool schemas and error handling
- **Dependency risks**: Reliance on external services availability
- **Data sensitivity**: Need careful handling of credentials and private data
