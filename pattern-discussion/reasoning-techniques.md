# Reasoning Techniques Pattern

## When to Use

- **Complex problem-solving**: Multi-step logical challenges
- **Mathematical reasoning**: Problems requiring systematic thinking
- **Strategic planning**: Evaluating multiple approaches
- **Critical analysis**: Deep examination of options
- **Decision making**: Weighing alternatives systematically
- **Creative exploration**: Generating diverse solutions

## Where It Fits

- **Research analysis**: Breaking down complex research questions
- **Code debugging**: Systematic problem identification
- **Business strategy**: Evaluating strategic options
- **Medical diagnosis**: Differential diagnosis reasoning
- **Legal analysis**: Building logical arguments

## Pros

- **Improved accuracy**: Systematic thinking reduces errors
- **Transparency**: Clear reasoning traces
- **Exploration**: Considers multiple solution paths
- **Robustness**: Multiple methods provide validation
- **Learning**: Reasoning traces help improvement
- **Flexibility**: Different techniques for different problems
- **Quality**: Higher quality solutions through deliberation

## Cons

- **Increased latency**: Multiple reasoning steps take time
- **Token consumption**: Verbose reasoning uses more tokens
- **Complexity**: Managing reasoning flows is challenging
- **Overthinking**: Can make simple problems complex
- **Context limits**: Long reasoning may exceed windows
- **Cost multiplication**: Multiple paths increase costs
- **Diminishing returns**: Extra reasoning may not help
